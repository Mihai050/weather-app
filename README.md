# weather-app


Welcome to my weather app !

This project is a weather app front-end that makes use of diverse API's and integrate them together. It uses Google's auto predict feature and geolocation in order to locate cities with precision and make a seamless experience for the user. It then uses a weather API to determine the weather and display it, and also uses a photo API to display in the background a random image from that city.


Please provide the API keys at dotenv.js and in index.html, at line 12 in the brackets and open with live server.
